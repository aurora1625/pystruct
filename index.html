          <h1>PyStruct</h1>

<p>This is my humble structural SVM and CRF implementation.
I use it for my research and hope you find it helpful.
Be aware that it might change drastically.</p>

<p>There are three basic parts to the implementation.</p>

<h2>Structural SVMs</h2>

<p>Knows about learning.</p>

<p>These implement max margin learning, similar to SVM^struct.
There is a subgradient and a QP version. 
They are not particularly optimized but at this part is usually not the
bottleneck in structured learning, so the is not really an issue. It is
possible to put positivity constraints on certain weight.
There is also a simple perceptron.</p>

<h2>CRFs aka Problems</h2>

<p>Knows about the problem.</p>

<p>These know about the structure of the problem, the loss and the inference.
This is basically the part that you have to write yourself when using the
Python interface in SVM^struct.
I am only working on pairwise models and there is support for grids and
general graphs. I am mostly working on the grids at the moment.</p>

<h2>Inference Solvers</h2>

<p>Does the inference.</p>

<p>There are some options to use different solvers for inference.
A linear programming solver using GLPK is included.
I have Python interfaces for several other methods on github,
including LibDAI, QPBO, AD3 and GCO (submodular graph cuts).</p>

<p>This is where the heavy lifting is done and in some sense these backends
are exchangeable. I'm hoping to unify stuff a bit more here.</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>

<p>There is also some stuff on latent SVMs here that is my current research and
I'd ask you not to steal it ;)</p>

<p>For updates, read my blog at <a href="http://peekaboo-vision.blogspot.com">http://peekaboo-vision.blogspot.com</a></p>

<p>There are not publications yet that you can cite for this, I'm hoping there
will be some in the future.</p>

<p>Btw: this is research with unit tests!</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>There is no need to compile anything, this pure Python.
There are quite a couple of requirements, though:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You need cvxopt for the cutting plane SVM solver and linear programming inference.
By default I use the glpk solver for the LP, so you need that, too, if you want to use LP inference.</p></li>
<li><p>You need sklearn for some tidbits here and there, also I import joblib from sklearn.</p></li>
<li>
<p>For the other inference algorithms that are wrapped in the inference folder,
you need the following of my repositories. You can just pick and choose from
those, but lack of methods will make some tests fail.</p>
